These three very powerful axioms in set theory turn out to be equivalent, and it
is not easy to see why. To review what they say,

1. Zorn's Lemma : a partially ordered set with upper bounds for every totally
   ordered subset has at least one maximal element
2. Axiom of Choice : if $F$ is a function on $I$ such that $F(i)\neq\phi,
   \forall i\in I$, then there exists a choice function $f$ on $I$ such that
   $f(i)\in F(i), \forall i\in I$
3. Well-ordering Principle : every set can be totally ordered

As the [popular joke](https://books.google.co.in/books?id=eqUv3Bcd56EC&q=Bona&redir_esc=y#v=snippet&q=Bona&f=false) goes

> The Axiom of Choice is obviously true, the Well-ordering principle is
> obviously false; and who can tell about Zorn's Lemma?

# Zorn's Lemma $\implies$ Axiom of Choice

1. Define $X$ as the partially successful attempts to construct a choice
   function, i.e. set of pairs $\langle J, g\rangle$ such that $J\subset I$ and
   $g$ is a partial choice function on $J$.
2. Define a partial order on $X$ as

   $$
   \langle J, g\rangle\leq \langle J', g'\rangle\\
   \iff\\ J\subset J'\textrm{ and } g = g'|_J (\textrm{i.e. $g'$ extends $g$})
   $$

3. If $Y$ is any totally ordered subset of $X$, then we can construct a maximal
   element $\langle \bar{J}, \bar{g}\rangle $ as follows

   $$
   \bar{J} = \bigcup_{\langle J, g \rangle\in Y} J,\\
   \bar{g}(j) = g(j),\textrm{ for any defined } g(j)\in Y
   $$

   Observe that total ordering of $Y$ forces a unique choice for $g(j)$.
4. Thus, by Zorn's Lemma there exists a maximal element $\langle J_{max},
   g_{max}\rangle$. Now it suffices to prove that $J_{max} = I$, as it implies
   $g_{max}$ is the choice function on $I$.
5. Assume on the contrary that $i\in I$ and $i\not\in J_{max}$. Then we can
   extend $\langle J_{max}, g_{max}\rangle$ as $\langle J_{max}\cup \\{ i \\},
   g_{max}\cup (g_{max}(i) := a)\rangle$ for any $a\in F(i)$, contradicting
   maximality.  Note that choosing any $a\in F(i)$ is **not** the same as the
   Axiom of Choice -- making a single arbitrary choice only requires ZF axioms
   (exercise : try to prove!), whereas the latter is about making arbitrary
   choices arbitrary number of times.
